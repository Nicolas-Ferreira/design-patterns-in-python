# Design Patterns in Python

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).
The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: C#, Java, Python and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.
The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there.


## The SOLID Design Principles

### Single Responsability Principle
* A class should only have one reason to change
* Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

### Open-Closed Principle
* Classes should be open for extension but close for modification

### Liskow Substitution Principle
* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype
* Any function that use a class should also work for any derived classes

### Interface Segregation Principle
* Don't put too much into an interface, split into separate interfaces
* YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

### Dependency Inversion Principle
* High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
